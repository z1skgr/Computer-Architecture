## General Information
in the next workshops you will partially implement the core of a dynamic processor
pipeline based on tomasulo's algorithm. Its basic elements are: (a)
Reservation Stations, Functional Units, Register File (Register Result Status), Common Data Bus
(CDB), and checking the above. the design should be structured to allow
changes later (namely the introduction of a Reorder Buffer and an access unit
memory







## Parts
* Tomasulo algorithm
* Tomasulo + Reorder Buffer + Ld/St Queue

## Setup
Xilinx ISEÂ® design suite 13.7 and above

## Acknowledgements
* This project was created for the requirements of the lesson Computer Architecture
